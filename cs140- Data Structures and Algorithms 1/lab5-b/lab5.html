<h1> CS140 -- Lab Assignment 5 (130 pts: Fall 2020)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>

In this lab, you will write a C++ program for solving a sudoku game. 
The goal of the exercise is 
for you gain experience with recursion and backtracking.

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
All work
should be contained the file called "Sudoku.cpp".
The due date is 11:59pm Tuesday Oct 27, 2020. 
NOTE: You don't need two weeks to do this 
assignment, but as Exam 2 will require some of your attention,
you get a little extra time.
The assignment may be (much) more difficult than you think. 
Get started early. You will thank yourself later.

<h3>Sudoku primer</h3>

You presumably know how to play the Sudoku game, but if you don't,
<href a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku> 
wikipedia<a> gives an introduction that
includes the history and other variants of the game. 
Basically,
the objective is to fill a 9-by-9 grid with numbers from 
1 to 9 in such a way that the following simple condition is met:
each row, column, and 3-by-3 block contains each number exactly once.
If you like this kind of thing, Bob Harris (a former MS student
of mine who went on to get a PhD from Penn State) maintains a 
number of a Squiggly Sudoku puzzles on 
his website (see <href a=http://www.bumblebeagle.org/dusumoh>
www.bumblebeagle.org<a>). 
His puzzles are so good, he had one printed
in an issue of Scientific American.  Pretty cool!

<h3>Code you need to write </h3>

Write the following code.
Be sure to check it rigorously. Don't submit code
that doesn't compile, doesn't work, or doesn't come close
to doing the right thing. Work with the TAs well in advance
of the deadline to get your problems sorted out. 
<p>

</UL>
<LI>
Run the script /home/cosc140/labs/lab5/copy to obtain
a Hydra executable called "ssudoku"
that can create and solve sudoku games.
You will also get a makefile and a game
to get you started. You can always generate more. 
The underlying random number generator is seeded 
differently each second meaning you are unlikely to
reproduce a particular game. Therefore, make sure you 
use unique file names for different runs.

<p>
Example sudoku output is shown below 
in the form of simple ascii grids. 
The makepdf script also given to you creates
a nice printable pdf version for pen-and-paper fun.
This script only works on Hydra machines and MacBooks.

<p>
The solution executable has two modes, namely,
create (-c) and solve (-s). You only need to 
write code for the solve mode. The create mode generates
a complete sudoku solution, then randomly
resets as many grid cells to zero (equivalent to blank) 
as possible while ensuring that the resulting puzzle
has a unique solution. That way, you can compare the
solution executable's output with your output when
you start solving the puzzles.
Generating a new game can sometimes takes a while.
If you get tired of waiting, kill the program (ctrl-C) and
run it again.

<p>
To help you get going, the copy script gives you a
source code file called "Sudoku.cpp" that does all the
boring work associated with checking commandline options,
reading, writing, and displaying games. Your job is to
add the missing pieces as described next.

<LI>
For 20 points,
augment "Sudoku.cpp" with code for error checking
both games that you read and solutions that you
(ultimately) produce. 
Specifically, update private member function 
sudoku::read() to check that 
grid indices and values are valid when reading 
a new game; grid indices must be in the range
0-8 while grid values must be in the range 0-9.
The value check should be placed in its own
private member function called 
sudoku::error_check_value() as it must also be 
performed on solutions before displaying them
and writing them to file.
Be forewarned that
while 0 is a valid grid value for a new game
when it is read from file, it is not a valid grid
value
after the game has been solved as it indicates
a blank cell; you should consequently have
sudoku::error_check_value() take
arguments that define the value range checked.
Lastly, create and use private member function 
sudoku::error_check_uniqueness() to make sure
solutions are valid; the grid values must be unique for 
each row, column and block. 
Error checking should print offending data to stderr 
before bailing out (exit(0)).
See code behavior examples below.
<p>

<LI>
For 85 points, update Sudoku.cpp to solve the 
commandline specified game.
Have public member function sudoku::solve() 
initialize the computation and carry out
the error checking described above.
Have private member function sudoku::solve(arguments) 
carry out the recursion. This function takes 
arguments that tells it what to do and on what data.
What the arguments represent depends on your choice of
implementation.
<p>

Pseudo-code for the recursive solve() function looks
as follows:
<pre>
solve(arguments) {
  if solution found,
    return solution-found

  set cell index (i,j)
  determine valid values
  if no valid values left,
    return road-to-nowhere

  iterate thru valid values {
    game[i][j] = next value
    if solve(arguments) == solution-found
      return solution-found
  }

  reset: game[i][j] = 0
  return road-to-nowhere
}
</pre>
In words,
the recursive search for the solution is based 
on enumerating valid values for each empty cell in numerical
order. 
When a particular sequence of choices makes it impossible to
continue, backtracking is used to return to the last 
viable configuration such that you can try the next value.
As you have seen in class, recursion is a deceptively 
simple way to solve a problem, and it is easy to mess it up.
Pay attention to your base cases as they stop
the recursion. Likewise, pay attention to the 
code that advances you toward the base cases,
since if this doesn't work, your code will either
stop prematurely or not at all!
<p>

Hint: Make sure your recursive code
doesn't clobber the solution when it works its way
back out to the original call to sudoku::solve()
in the main function. Use call sudoku::display()
to visualize the solution and use sudoku::write() 
to write the solution to file.
<p>

Create private member function sudoko::valid_values() that 
determines and returns the set of valid values for a 
given grid cell. For a blank
grid, the answer would be [1,2,...,9]. As the grid gets 
filled out, numbers should be ruled out depending on the
row, column and 3x3 block context. 
Use the same logic for this as you did when writing 
the sudoku::error_check_uniqueness() function.
<p>

Add code to the recursive solve function to <i>ensure that 
the next cell considered has the lowest number of possible 
valid values of those left</i>.
Should the set of valid values be empty,
the recursion has backed itself into a corner.
Go back to the previous grid cell and try a different 
data value. If that doesn't work, go back yet another step, etc.
In other words, apply backtracking. 
Do this automatically using appropriately placed "return" calls.
Think long and hard about what information needs to be 
passed back where and how.
Eventually, you
will find the solution. Consider that a base case.
There may be other reasons why the computation
cannot continue.
If so, they too should stop the recursion. 
<p>

Hint: Draw inspiration from nqueens::placequeen() from the 
nqueens_handout. The two games are clearly different but 
their mode of operation is essentially the same.
<p>

<LI>
For 25 points, add the code needed to pretty-print the elapsed
time for the call to the solve() function. Specifically, implement 
a recursive function called elapsed() that takes two arguments,
namely, a floating point number
representing the fractional number of seconds 
from from an epoch to an event,
i.e., the difference between the times labeled T0 and T1 in 
Sudoku.cpp, and an integer indicating the units associated
with the number. Initially, the latter should be 0 for seconds
(sec).
Each time the elapsed() function calls itself, the first argument gets
multiplied by 1000 while the second argument gets incremented
by one to first represent milliseconds (msec) and 
then microseconds (usec). The omega timing class you are given
code is based on microseconds elapsed since Jan 1, 1970. There
is thus no need to handle nanoseconds and below.
<p>

As indicated by the 
example output shown below, then time values are formatted as 
seconds if they are greater than 100 milliseconds,
milliseconds if they are greater than 100 microseconds,
and microseconds otherwise.
Think carefully how this can be translated into recursion.
A for-loop might have been easier to implement,
but that's not the point of this exercise.
Have the elapsed() function return a string object with the
time elapsed printed using two decimal places. 
Consider using sprintf() (man 3 sprintf) instead
of a stringstream (more complicated). 
Have the main function print the returned string as well
as the floating point number representing the
initial elapsed time using six decimal places.

Notice the cascade of errors that resulted. 
That is, each error generated multiple cases
of non-uniqueness. While this may seem
confusing, keeping track and only reporting
the first instances is more trouble than it's
worth. Use the simple error checking indicated
here to help ensure you load a valid game and
that your code produces a valid solution.
