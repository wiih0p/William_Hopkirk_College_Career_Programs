<h1> CS140 -- Lab Assignment 4 (130 pts: Fall 2020)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
This lab has you write a program called Hashtable
which brings together many of the data structures and C++/STL concepts
you have learned about.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
The Hashtable program is due 11.59pm Tuesday, October 13, 2020.

<h3>Keeping track of words in files</h3>

Ascii files contain alpha-numerically encoded words plus some
punctuation and control characters such as newline. 
Your task is to write a C++ program called Hashtable.cpp
that reads the ascii file specified on the command-line 
along with some other optional arguments
(and provides an error and exits as appropriate),
builds a hash table of the words in the file
along with the line numbers at which they are found,
and then allows the user to enter an unlimited number of
search terms from stdin. Each search must print 
the line number for each occurrence of the search
term and the corresponding lines of text to stdout. 
Only the first instance of a word on a line should be stored.

See example output below. Note that the Hashtable program 
will look for word occurrences while the unix command
grep looks for word and substring occurences (e.g. "so" is a word
as well as a substring of "awesome").

<p>
All code is to be placed in a single file called
"Hashtable.cpp" with class definitions and utility
functions at the top and the main application function 
at the bottom.
Do not split your code into header and source code files.

<h3>Code you need to write </h3>

<UL>
<LI>
For 0 points,
implement hashtable_qp.cpp from the hashtable2_handout. This will
form the base for your work. Make sure the code compiles and runs
as expected. You only need the hash function for string data.
Delete the others.

<p>
<LI>
For 80 points, modify the hash_table class code as follows. 

<p>
Augment the hash_table class with a private
subclass called "key_line" that uses a string to hold a
key (word) and a vector of integers to keep track of all the
line numbers where the key is found in the input file. 
You will neither need to implement a constructor or 
a destructor (the defaults will do fine), 
but you must implement a key_line::inuse() member function 
that indicates whether the object holds a key or not.
You will also need to overload the 
comparison operator, i.e., operator==(). 
That's it for key_line
which should be based on a struct instead of a class to make
it readily available to the hash_table member functions.

<p>
Remove all template references used by the hash_table class
which should instead be modified to explicitly use the key_line
subclass. This includes making member functions 
qprobe(), insert(), and resize() all
use key_line::inuse() when checking to see
if an entry exists.

<p>
Modify the call to the hash_table::nextprime() member function 
to simply provide the current table size as the argument.
Modify nextprime() itself to compute the next prime number
which is greater than or equal to two times the given 
argument plus one. With the initial number thus being odd,
exclude even numbers from the search by incrementing the
possible next prime number by two.

<p>
Modify the hash_table::insert() member function to add a 
key if one is not present in the hash table for the word
in question.
Update each key_line object to 
maintain a sorted list of all <it>unique </it> 
line numbers where it occurs.
That is, search the line number vector mentioned above
and if not found, add the new line number at the end of
the list. Use std::find() to carry out the search. 

<p>
Add a public member function hash_table::find() 
that returns a constant reference to the vector
of line numbers associated with the hash table entry 
for a given key. If the key is not found, a reference to
an empty vector is returned. You deal with this in 
the main program.

<p>
Add a public member function called
hash_table::insert_done() as a wrapper to a private
member function called hash_table::showload() that
prints load statistics to stdout as shown below.
Call this function when all data from the input
file has been inserted.

<p>
Update the hash_table code to optionally
track and show simple usage statistics, 
namely, the number of hash table slots used and available,
and the total number of collisions encountered when 
inserting new data. Add needed boolean variables that control 
whether and when this is done. Make the default false and
add a public member function called 
hash_table::set_showstats() that
can change this to true.
Since collisions should not be counted when searching
during a call to hash_table::find(), 
update member function hash_table::qprobe() 
to take a second argument that controls whether collisions 
are counted or not.

<LI>
For 50 points, modify the main program as follows.

<p>
Add parsing of command line arguments. 
The input text file is specified as "-f file".
Argument "-N numwords" is optional
where numwords is the number of words
initially expected to be inserted into the hash table.
Make the default 23. If given a number less than 1,
exit the program with a meaningful error message.
Argument "-showstats" is optional. If set, 
the public hash_table::set_showstats() member
function is called. See example output below.
The arguments can appear in any order. Be sure
to check that enough command line arguments exist
before reading them.

<p>
Main operates as follows.
Open the input file specified and enter into
a loop that reads and processes the text lines. 
Save each text line in a data cache,
e.g., vector&lt;string&gt;, for retrieval later on.
Then change all punctuation characters, 
i.e., (, ), {, }, and ., to a blank space. 
Specifically,
wrap std::ispunct(), which can handle the detection 
(see "man ispunct"), inside a function to be called
replace_punctuation() that you pass along to
std::transform() which sweeps thru the text line
characters.  Have function
replace_punctuation() return either the character
tested (give as its input argument) or a blank space
(for punctuation characters).
Finally, use a string stream to parse the
resulting text line into words which you insert into
a hash table along with the current line number.
Terminate the loop and
close the input file upon EOF.
Then call hash_table::insert_done() to print the
final load statistics.

<p>
Add a second loop that prompts the user for
words to search for. 
Print all line numbers and the corresponding text for each
successfull search. Print nothing for an unsuccessfull search.
Use the vector of line numbers returned by hash_table::find()
to do this. Look up the text in the above mentioned data cache
for each line number. Terminate this loop upon EOF.
See output examples below.
<p>

Make no assumptions about the number of lines in the input file.
Make no assumptions about the number of characters or words
on each line.
The test files may be pure ascii text, html code, or even a C++ 
program. Your code should work regardless of the type of ascii
data stored in the file.
<p>

<LI> 
Run the script /home/cosc140/labs/lab4/copy to obtain
a Hydra executable called shashtable that works as described above,
a copy of the dictionary file, and a makefile.
Other than that, you're on your own!

Max number of slots:  74139
Number of collisions: 33504

</pre>

In case you wonder why only 74099 slots are used when the dict.txt
file contains 74136 words, the reason is that some words
contain apostrophes which we remove thereby creating duplicates
of the remaining subwords. These are only inserted once. The
goal is not to store everything, but to achieve a simple extraction
of words without punctuation characters.
