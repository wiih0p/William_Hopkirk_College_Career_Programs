<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 2 (100 pts: Spring 2021)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
Another week, another sorting assignment.
Similar to Lab 1,
you will define a class for storing multi-column data
consisting of a firstname, a lastname, and a phone number 
(all made up, but you knew that),
read unspecified amounts of such data from a given file 
and apply
the std::sort algorithm before you print the result to stdout.
Then the real work begins by
you implementing a variant of the quicksort algorithm 
described in class that in its basic form replaces std::sort and
in a more advanced version based on the quickselect algorithm that
allows partitioning of the data followed
by sorting within a given range.
<p>

Read the assignment a couple of times. Look at the output 
examples below. Run the solution code to become familiar 
with its behavior. Ask questions on Piazza so the whole
class can benefit from your confusion. Chances are you 
are not alone. Do this for every lab assignment.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Your friendly TAs will tell you how to submit your work to Canvas.
Do not email your code to the instructor or the TAs as they cannot 
upload the code to Canvas for you.
<p>

Qsort.cpp is due 11:59pm Thursday Feb 11, 2021.
You only submit this one file. The incremental
development outlined below is merely intended to make
solving the problem more manageable. 
The submitted code must compile and execute without
seg faulting to be graded.
<p>

<hr>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

Run the script
/home/cosc302/labs/lab2/copy to obtain 
a Hydra executable called sqsort, 
data files called
list1.txt, list2.txt, and list3.txt, 
a skeleton program called
Qsort.cpp, and a makefile for compiling it
into a Hydra executable (once properly fleshed out).
Your job is to write the missing source code which must
behave as described next.
<p>


<h3>Assignment details</h3>

<UL>

<LI>
<b>Vers 1</b> Modify Qsort.cpp as follows. 
The data class has three private
data members: firstname, lastname, and phonenumber. 
Add code for data class input and output operators.
The input operator simply reads each of data items when 
called.
The output operator prints a data object to stdout using 
the format: lastname firstname phonenumber. 
See examples below. Part of the assignment is for you
to figure out how to maintain a fixed width of the name field 
so that all phonenumbers are left justified to the same column 
position.
Finally, implement printlist() as a templated function that 
takes generic iterator arguments and steps thru the data
while printing to stdout.
Do whatever else is needed to make the program compile such as
adding missing header files and commenting out pseudo-code. 
Then test and make sure it reads and writes data from the 
list files as required.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Vers 2</b> Add an overloaded operator&lt; to the data class,
so you can impose an order on such objects. Test that it works by
applying the std::sort algorithm before writing the list content 
to stdout. Objects that have the same lastname should use the
firstnames to determine which is less than the other. Objects
that also have the same firstnames should use the phone numbers
to determine which is less than the other. See examples below.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Vers 3</b>
Add command line argument handling. When completed, any one
of the following three ways of calling Qsort should be valid:
<p>

<pre>
unix> Qsort -stl list.txt
unix> Qsort -rpivot list.txt
unix> Qsort -rpivot k0 k1 list.txt
</pre>

<p>
The first version executes the code from above.
The second version sorts the data using
your own implementation of quicksort.
The third version partitions the input data using quickselect
below before applying quicksort to sort the data in the
range given by integers k0 and k1. Without checking,
assume that k0 is less than k1. 
Do check if k0 is less than 0, in which case 
it should silently be changed to 0. 
Likewise, check if k1 is greater than or equal to the number of 
elements in the data array, say N, and if so, silently change 
it to N-1.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Vers 4</b>
Implement quicksort as follows.
Copy the partition() and quicksort() functions 
from the class04_sorting_3 handout.
Replace the median-of-three pivot with a randomly chosen
index in the left-to-right range and use it to partition the data.
This new version forces you to think about how the median-of-three
partitioning code works since unlike for it, 
you may now need to explicitly check and 
prevent going out-bounds during the search for data pairs to swap. 
To make you think even more about the algorithm, 
merge all the functionality into the quicksort()
function. That is, do not have an external function that carries
out the partitioning. Keep it all inside the quicksort() function 
which is  called from main.
Test and compare the output with what you obtained using std::sort. 
The two output should be identical since they use the same comparison
operator.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Vers 5</b>
Copy the quickselect() function from the class04_sorting_3 handout.
Embed the random pivot based partition code that you
added to quicksort(). The resulting function will take four
arguments, i.e., quickselect(A, left, k, right) where A is a data
array, left and right designate the first and the last indices
to consider (the range), and k the element that needs to be
selected (found and put in its proper place).
Make whatever other modifications
are needed to get the code to compile. 
Test the program to make sure you the selection is correct.
<p>

Use quickselect(A, 0, k0, N-1) to put the k0-th element in its
proper location and partition the data in A accordingly.
That is, ensure that all data stored to the left of A[k0]
is lexicographically less than or equal to it.
All data stored to the right of A[k0] must likewise be
greater than or equal to it.
<p>

Then
use quickselect(A, k0, k1, N-1) to put the k1-th element in its
proper location and partition the data in A accordingly. Note
that data indexed below k0 is ignored at this point. When this
works, use the quicksort() function to sort the data in the 
k0 thru k1 index range.
<p>

This completes the assignment. Submit Qsort.cpp on Canvas after 
you have cleaned the code up and added a few comments.

The line numbers added to right for the last output are for illustrational purposes 
and not produced by the program. They help you see that the data in lines 3-5 is sorted
(by design), that the data lines 0-1, 6-7, and 9-10 are not, and that the data in 
lines 2 and 8 are (by chance).
