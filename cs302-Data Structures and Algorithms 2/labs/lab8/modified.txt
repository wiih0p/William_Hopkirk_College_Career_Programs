Poem by Ivana Bedone

My computer ate my homework.
Yes, it's troublesome, but true.
I thought I knew what I was doing,
but it's clear I had no clue.

It wiped out days of typing,
every keystroke that I'd made,
What really got me though, 
was it could have all been saved

But I found a good solution
and I smiled to hear the crash,
when I chucked it out the window
and it landed in the trash.
