<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 4 (175+25 pts: Spring 2021)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
In this lab you will write a program for embedding ASCII text
within a PPM image using a randomized algorithm for selecting
where to place the bits that make up the ASCII characters. 
We will call the program "crypto" which makes it sound
as if it is based on cryptography. In reality, it is a
case of steganography which according to Wikipedia
"is the art or practice of concealing a file, message, image, 
or video within another file, message, image, or video."
Either way, the program is actually pretty cool. 

<p>
Before you get any ideas to turn it into an app that
will make your rich, be forewarned that no attempt has been 
made to research the literature on the subjects of steganography
and crytopgraphy. In particular, somebody may hold a patent on 
a similar idea.
Besides, you would have to support JPG, HEIC and other standard
image formats that use compression which adds substantial 
complications.
The goal of the exercise is simpy to have you work with
formatted and binary file I/O as well as random numbers.
<p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

Run the script
/home/cosc302/labs/lab4/copy to obtain 
Hydra executables called scrypto1, scrypto2, and scrypto3, 
a handful of ppm images,
skeleton code in the form of the files
PPM.h, PPM.cpp, Rnumgen.h, Rnumgen.cpp, and Crypto.cpp 
and a makefile for compiling a Hydra executable 
(once properly fleshed out).
Your job is to write the missing source code which must
behave as described next. 
<p>

<h3>Assignment details</h3>

<UL>

<LI>
<b>PPM.h</b>: This header file defines 
an RGB struct and a PPM class for P6-type images.
<p>

The RGB struct
has three unsigned char members called
R, G, and B.
The constructor sets the values of these to 0.
The code can be included in the struct definition.
<p>

The PPM class defines all functionality
needed to read, write, and store ppm image.
Public member functions include a constructor 
which initializes member data, a destructor which
deallocates the dynamically allocated memory used to
store the image (aptly called img),
read() and write() functions for handling file I/O,
an overloaded []-operator for index based
lookup of pixel values, e.g., 
img[i][j].R, img[i][j].G, or img[i][j].B,
and get_Nrows()and get_Ncols() functions for
obtained the values of the same named data members. 
All but the read() and write() function code can be
included in the class definition.
<p>

Note that the overloaded []-operator must return a pointer
to an RGB object. That way, img[i][j].R translates
into RGB *rowptr = img[i] followed by rowptr[j].R
which is a standard array operation and 
thus supported by the compiler.
<p>

All data members must be private and the image must be 
stored in a dynamically allocated array of RGB data. 
Specifically, the image must be accessed using a
double-pointer to an RGB object. More details below
on how it's used.
<p>

<LI> 
<b>PPM.cpp</b>: This file implements PPM::read() and 
PPM::write() functions which both take a single argument, 
namely, the name of a file.
<p>

PPM::read() opens the given file,
reads and stores the P6 header info using 
formatted file I/O,
allocates storage for the image data
which is then read using binary file I/O.
Error checking must be included for 
successful opening of the file 
(hint: cf. fstream::is_open()), 
the proper P6 format, 
a max value of 255, and the correct number
of bytes read.
<p>

When allocating memory for the image data,
keep in mind that a 2D array can be superimposed
on the inherent 1D data read from file.
Let PPM::img be a pointer to 
an array of pointers that indicate the location
of the first pixel in each row of the image.
Allocate enough memory to hold the entire image
and assign this to PPM::img[0]. Then update
PPM::[1], ..., PPM::[Nrows-1]. That way the
overloaded []-operator described above works
as intended.

Assuming the given file is "image.ppm",
PPM::write() creates file name "image_wmsg.ppm" 
where "wmsg" is short
for "with message" (in other words, an image which
has text embedded within it), opens the file,
and writes the P6 header info followed by the 
binary image data.
Error checking must be included for 
successful opening of the file 
(hint: cf. ios::is_open()).
<p>

<LI>
<b>Rnumgen.h</b>: This file defines a random number
generator whose distribution can be "shaped" by 
user provided data.
See code handout from class.
<p>

<b>Rnumgen.cpp</b>: This file implements the Rnumgen
member functions. See code handout from class.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Crypto.cpp</b>: This file implements the
main() function, the encode() and decode()
functions as all as all other support code
which includes a set_pixel_list() function.
<p>

The main() function parses command line arguments,
e.g.,
"-encode|decode image.ppm [-option=value]" where
the pipe symbol means logical OR (standard unix)
and [...] indicate an optional argument 
(also standard unix).
A meaningful error message is printed if 
the proper "-encode|decode" mode option is missing,
or if an unknown option is given.
Then a PPM image object is instantiated. 
The specified image file is read,
a list of target pixels is created,
and both are passed to the encode() or decode() 
function as appropriate.
<p>

<b>Vers 1</b>
Crypto1 creates the framework for the asssignment. 
For this version,
the set_pixel_list() function determines the
size of a given PPM image
(first argument), then adds all even
(row,column) pixel indices to a vector list 
(second argument). That is, fill the pixel list
with (0,0), (0,2), ..., (2,0), (2,2), ..., etc. 
You change this to be random in Crypto2 and Crypto3.
<p>

The encode() function is given references to the
input PPM image (first argument) and the pixel list
described above. Text is read from 
standard input (cin) and encoded into the PPM image.
More specificially, you repeatedly replace an RGB bit
with a text bit in locations specified by the
pixel index list. 
Warning:
You may have to read the how-to description 
several times before you fully understand the process. 
<p>

Read and encode the text one character at a time
including all white space
(hint: cf. fstream::get()). Furthermore, extract
and encode one character bit at a time. 
Since the MSB (b7) is always 0.
you should only process the seven LSBs (b6..b0).
The pixel index list tells you which pixels to
target. Use one pixel per character bit. 
Alternate between the R, G, and B colors. 
Use bit logic to extract the bits in order from b0
to b6.
(hint: x&gt;&gt;k shifts
the k<i>th</i> bit to the LSB position and
x &amp; 0x1 sets all but the LSB to 0). 
Use bit logic to encode the extracted bit.
That is, replace the LSB (b0) of the target pixel color
with the extracted character bit
(hint: x &amp;= 0xFE zeros out the x-LSB while
x |= (y &amp; 0x1) sets it to the y-LSB).
When all the text has been processed, add an ETX
(0x3) character, so you know when to stop
when decoding an image. The ETX has been declared
in Crypto.cpp for your convenience.
<p>

The decode() function reverses the process. Once
you understand how the encoding works, this is
relatively simple. Create the same pixel index
list and use it to extract the LSB (b0) from
seven pixels (to produce b6..b0). 
Combine these along with a leading 0-bit (b7)
to form an 8-bit character that you print to standard out 
(hint: cf. fstream::put()). Stop when the ETX
character has been extracted.
If you do it right, you see the same text as
you encoded. If you don't, you get garbage. 
Enjoy!
<p>

<b>Vers 2</b>
Crypto2 adds randomness to the pixel index list.
Without this, somebody might figure out how to 
read your 
secret text by detecting patterns. As unlikely as
that is, we want to make it more difficult 
if not impossible.
Specifically, 
we will distribute the seven LSBs (b6..b0)
of each text character across seven <it>randomly</it>
chosen pixels.
Instead of just using the standard uniform random 
number generator 
(which we could and will seed with a secret number),
we will use a data driven distribution to make it
more unique. 
We will use the PPM input image itself for now. A
more sophisticated version is explored in Crypto3.
<p>

Modify the set_pixel_target() function as follows.
First compute a histogram of the color values 
for all pixels. To keep the size of the histogram managable,
extract four bits (b6..b3) from each color byte
and combine these to obtain a 12-bit color value.
Use bit-logic to grab each four-tuple and to place it
in the target integer. The end result should be
the bit sequence R6..R3 G6..G3 B6..B3.
The histogram is simply a count of how many times you 
encounter each of the 12-bit colors in the image.
Then instantiate a random number generator 
that can produce random numbers with probabilities that are
proportional to the histogram counts.
Use this random number generator to permute 
the pixel index list. 
In order to support processing of more than 2^12 = 4,096
pixels, combine two of these random numbers to form
a 24-bit number that allows processing of 2^24 = 16M pixels.
That is, r_24 = (r1_12 &lt;&lt; 12) | r2_12.
The heavy lifting can be done using the code from the
random number note and code handouts.
Add the rnumgen class definition to Rnumgen.h,
and add the member function implementations to
Rnumgen.cpp. 
Incorporate the randperm idea into the set_pixel_list() 
function.
Add a command line based optional seed value leaving
the default as 0.
<p>

If you do the above exactly the same way as the solution code,
one can decode what the other encodes.
If you do even the slightest thing differently 
(including when and how many times you call the random number 
generator), your code will not work with encodings produced 
by the solution code, but you can 
still have fun as it may work with its own encodings.
Brilliant!
<p>

<b>Vers 3</b>
<i>Crypto3 is required in order for CS307 students to get full credit but optional and available
for extra credit for CS302 students. That is, CS307 students will have up to 25 points deducted,
if the functionality described next is not included or doesn't work right. CS302 students 
will have up to 25 points added, if they complete this successfully.</i>
<p>

A simple, but effective encryption method consists of repeatly applying XOR to the characters
of the text with characters in a secret key known only to the sender and the receiver. Say the
text character is c and the key character is k, then it is easily shown that c=XOR(XOR(c,k)).
We will apply this idea as follows. The main() function will accept -key="text" as
an optional command line argument. The encode() and decode() functions will be given this text as a
third argument.  When a key is not specified, the key text is "GoVols!".
The encode() and decode() functions
apply XOR to each character before encoding and after decoding, respectively
(hint: XOR(x,y) = x^y). When the key text consists of multiple characters, use these in 
an alternating fashion. When the key text has been exhausted, start over from the beginning.
<p>

To prevent somebody from randomly guessing part of the key thereby possible being able to decode
some of the characters, we will randomly permute the characters. 
Create a set_encryption_key() function that takes two arguments, namely, the seed
value and key string optionally provided by the user.
Create a histogram of the four LSBs (b3..b0) for the characters in the key string. 
Then instantiate a random number generator 
that can produce random numbers with probabilities that are
proportional to the histogram counts.
Use this random number generator to permute 
the characters in the key string prior to encoding or decoding a message.
<p>

But wait, there is more! We will also allow a different image to be used to shape the
pixel list random generator. That is, two images are specified when running Crypto3 with
the first used to generate the pixel list and the other used for embedding the text.
Think of this as your secret image key which is then combined with the text key and
the seed value to produce the random sequence of pixels for which you either set or
reset the LSB. Good luck figuring out what the embedded message is if any of these
is missing.

<h3>Example Crypto1 output</h3>
<pre>
unix> ./Crypto1 -encode plane.ppm 
this is a secret message
embedded within an image

unix> ./Crypto1 -decode plane_wmsg.ppm 
this is a secret message
embedded within an image
</pre>

The plane_wmsg.ppm image will look similar to the
plane.ppm image, but if you compare them at the bit level,
they are not identical.

<h3>Example Crypto2 output</h3>

<pre>
unix> ./Crypto2 -encode plane.ppm 
this is a secret message
embedded within an image

unix> ./Crypto2 -decode plane_wmsg.ppm 
this is a secret message
embedded within an image
</pre>

The plane_wmsg.ppm image produced by Crypto2 will
will look similar to the one produced by Crypto1,
but if you compare them at the bit level,
they are not identical. Also, the two programs
cannot be used together (try it).

<pre>
unix> ./Crypto2 -encode -seed=302 plane.ppm 
this is a secret message
embedded within an image

unix> ./Crypto2 -decode -seed=302 plane_wmsg.ppm 
this is a secret message
embedded within an image
</pre>

The plane_wmsg.ppm image produced by this run will
look similar to the one produced by the previous 
run that didn't specify a seed value,
but if you compare them at the bit level,
they are not identical.

<pre>
unix> ./Crypto2 -encode -seed=302 plane.ppm 
this is a secret message

Not knowing the seed value makes decoding impossible.
