<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 1 (120 pts: Spring 2021)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
WELCOME to your first CS302 lab. During the semester, you will be taken
through a sequence of increasingly more difficult programming
assignments.
They will be challenging but matched to your programming skills which
will become better and better as we go along.
In case you find yourself spending too much time on an
assignment, be sure to seek help from the TAs or the instructor (in that order).
You can also post questions to the class using Piazza
(post conceptual questions as opposed to detailed code).
The important thing is for you not to back yourself into a corner where you
get so frustrated that you give up.
<p>

You should find this first assigment (relatively) easy to do as it evolves
around concepts you learned and practiced in CS140. 
If you took CS140 using Windows, use this lab to become familiar with Unix as
all your programs must compile and run on a Hydra machine.

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Your friendly TAs will tell you how to submit your work on Canvas 
in lab. 
Take good notes!
The due date for Fruit1 and Fruit2 is 11.59PM Tuesday Feb 2, 2021, but
you might want to wrap up earlier than, so you can get a head start
on Lab 2.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>

Each day, the folks at Josephine's Juice Bar
buy a lot of fruit for their smoothies.
Management would like to know the quantity purchased
of each different type of fruit (all fruit is purchased by weight)
and at what cost plus the total
cost.
Your job is write two C++ programs that 
solve the problem based respectively on an array list and
a linked list.
Kidding aside,
the real task, of course, is to get you back in the programming
saddle before we get deep into new data structures and algorithms.
Those of you not used to "word problems" will also gain some
experience deciphering what lab assignments ask you to do.
<p>

Run the script /home/cosc302/labs/lab1/copy 
to obtain two Hydra
executables called sfruit1 and sfruit2, data files called
list1.txt, list2.txt, and list3.txt, skeleton programs called
Fruit1.cpp and Fruit2.cpp, and a makefile for compiling them
into Hydra executables (once properly fleshed out).
<p>

<h3>Assignment Details</h3>

<UL>
<LI> <b>Fruit1 -- 50 pts</b>
<p>
Write a program called "Fruit1" that reads a 
sequence of fruit purchases from file. Each
purchase consists of the name of a fruit, 
the quantity purchased, and the unit cost.
Store the purchases in an array list, e.g.,
std::vector&lt &gt, in one of three ways before
you pretty-print the content to stdout as decribed
below. Develop your program incrementally. 
<p>

<b>Vers 1</b> Create a struct called fruit
that can the hold the relevant data, namely, the name of the
fruit, the quantity purchased, and the unit cost.
Read a data file from stdin using a while loop. 
Enter the data in a fruit struct which you store in 
the array list in the order read from file.
Print the name, quantity, unit cost, product purchase cost,
and cumulative total purchase cost to stdout.
<p>

<b>Vers 2</b> Update the output formatting
to appear like shown below. To make your life easier,
the field widths used are: name (20), quantity (5),
unit cost (4), product purchase cost (7), and
total purchase cost (8). Be forewarned there may be
an additional white space or two between the fields.
All floating point numbers are printed to an
accuracy of 2 decimal places.
<p>

<b>Vers 3</b> Add commandline argument processing
to allow selection of three mode options, namely,
inorder, sortall, and sortone. See call pattern
and associated output below.
You must check that the correct number 
of arguments is given, and that the first argument
is one the three mentioned (preceeded by a dash).
<p>

<b>Vers 4</b> Add code needed to support option
sortall which causes the data to be sorted 
in lexicographical order with respect to the fruit
name. Similar named entries must appear in the same
order as when read from file. To do this,
overload operator&lt for struct fruit and
apply std::stable_sort (more about this algorithm in 
class). 
Your pretty-print output code should work unchanged.
<p>

<b>Vers 5</b> Add code needed to support option
sortone which combines entries of the same named
fruit into one by adding the quantities. When 
done, shrink the array list to contain just these
entries.
Your pretty-print output code should work unchanged.

<LI> <b>Fruit2 -- 70 pts</b>
<p>
Write a program called "Fruit2" that reads a 
sequence of fruit purchases from file. Each
purchase consists of the name of a fruit, 
the quantity purchased, and the unit cost.
Store the purchases in a linked list, the
implemention of which you write yourself.
That is, DO NOT use std::list&lt &gt. 
Again, process data in one of three ways before
you pretty-print the content to stdout as decribed
above. Develop your program incrementally.
Keep your list code as simple as possible. Do NOT place it
in a class. Rather, write the code "in-place" where used
(e.g., inserting node with new data, 
printing data from nodes, deleting nodes from list 
when deallocating memory at the end).
<p>

<b>Vers 1</b> Copy the code from Fruit1.cpp to
Fruit2.cpp while maintaing the skeleton code
comments for the latter. Bring the code back
to Vers 3. 
Declare a struct node as the basic building 
block for the linked list replacing the
array list. Consider using a double-linked
list but feel free to keep it single-linked
if you prefer. Either way, you must use a
dataless header node to refer to the list.
Read data from file as before only this time
incrementally build a linked list that stores
it. Hint: To preserve the order of the data,
new data must be inserted at the end of the list.
Update the print loop to sweep thru the linked
list nodes while printing the data to stdout
using the same format as before.
Add code to deallocate list memory when done.
<p>

<b>Vers 2</b> Update the code to either 
insert new data in the order read from 
file OR sorted in lexicographical order with 
respect to the fruit name. You must add
code for explictly making this happen. Do NOT
rely on a sorting algorithm. Instead, find the
correct place in the list for each new data
entry as it gets inserted. 
Hint:
Consider updating 
struct fruit to also overload operator&lt;=.
Your pretty-print output code should work unchanged.
Same goes for the linked list cleanup code.
<p>

<b>Vers 3</b> Update the code to either 
insert new data in the order read from 
file, sorted in lexicographical order with 
respect to the fruit name, OR doing the latter 
while consolidating similar name entries.
You must once again add code for explictly making this 
happen. That is, find the
correct place in the list for a data entry as
it gets inserted. If the fruit has been purchased
before, increment the quantity by the new amount.
Otherwise, create and insert a new node.
Hint:
Consider updating 
struct fruit to also overload operator== and
operator+= where the latter adds the quantity
value associated with the new data to that of
the existing old data.
Your pretty-print output code should work unchanged.
Same goes for the linked list cleanup code.
<p>

<LI>
These verbal descriptions may seem confusing. 
If so, take look at the data and output examples
shown below. If you still don't quite understand
what needs to be done, ask questions on Piazza and
in lab. You may also find making drawings of what 
needs to happen to be helpful.

<h3>Grading rubric</h3>

<p>
NOTE 1: You must have a correctly functioning executable for each program you 
are asked to write.
Verify your output against working solution executables. 
The TAs will do the same when grading your
submissions.  As stated by the lab grading guidelines, 
some points awarded will be based on what the code does (whether
it behaves correctly, produces the correct output, etc), while
some points will be based on how the code works
(whether it is uses the proper data structures, algorithms, implementation
strategy, etc).

<p>
NOTE 2: Always use <b>naming conventions</b> described in the lab assignment.

<h4>Fruit1 (50 points)</h4>
<pre>
*05: Struct fruit incl. operator&lt overloading.
*10: Commandline argument processing: options inorder, sortall, sortone.
*20: Data processing using inorder option: file reading, output printing.
*05: Data processing using sortall option: std::stable_sort.

</pre>

<h4>Fruit2 (70 points)</h4>
